# Overview

A array is a special object that can store multiple items at once. Among one of the special characteristics of a array in javascript is its flexibility, it can grow or shrink as needed. However, for this project, we set the array size manually and it shows a warning when the size of the array exceeds the limit. We can only appends items in this array for now by clicking pop() button.
