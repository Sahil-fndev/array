# Overview

An array is a special object that can store multiple items at once. Among one of the special characteristics of an array in JavaScript is its flexibility, it can grow or shrink as needed. However, for this project, we set the array size manually and it shows a warning when the size of the array exceeds the limit. We can only append items in this array for now by clicking pop () button.
